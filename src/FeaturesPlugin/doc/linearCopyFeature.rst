Input fields:

- **Main objects** panel contains shapes to be translated. Shapes are selected in 3D OCC viewer or object browser;
- **First direction** defines translation in the first direction:

  - **Vector of translation**  defines vector along which the object will be translated. Vector is edge, axis selected in 3D OCC viewer or object browser;
  - **Step** defines the distance between the shape copies;
  - **Nb. Copies** is the number of shape copies;
 
- **Second direction** check-box turns on/off translation in the second direction:

  - **Vector of translation**  defines vector along which the object will be translated. Vector is edge, axis selected in 3D OCC viewer or object browser;
  - **Step** defines the distance between the shape copies;
  - **Nb. Copies** defines the number of shape copies.

**TUI Command**:  *model.addMultiTranslation(Part_doc, [shape], axis1, step1, Nb1, axis2, step2, Nb2)*

**Arguments**: 1 part + list of shapes in format *model.selection(TYPE, shape)* + 2 axis in format *model.selection(TYPE, shape)*+ 2 real (step values) + 2 integers (Nb. Copies).

Result
