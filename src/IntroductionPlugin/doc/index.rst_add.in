It is supposed that the application only a one OCC viewer will support. It means that the application will be able to show only a one 3d space. This 3d space can be represented in several view windows. Each of view windows will represent its own point of view on the 3d scene. This point of view can be modified by user with help of viewer commands like panning, zooming, scaling and so on. 
Architecture and functionality of viewer will be very similar to OCCViewer component from SALOME with modifications of view window look&feel.
