NewGEOM version 2.0.0

Compilation on LINUX:
=====================

  cd <sources_directory>
  source salome_env.sh
  source env_linux.sh
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${ROOT_DIR}/install ${ROOT_DIR}/sources
  make
  make install

or simply (only for not-SALOME prerequisites):

  make.sh

Note that it is possible to use SALOME installed environment for compilation. 
For this just import it (PDIR variable will be set automatically) or update 
salome_env.sh first "export" and import this script.


It will create a "build" and "install" folders. Environment is ready to launch an application:

  XGUI

Or without environment call:

  linux_run.sh


Compilation on Windows:
=======================
  cd <sources_directory>
  buildNewGEOM_rel.bat

It will launch the Visual Studio 2010. In it build for: "ALL_BUILD" and then "INSTALL" projects.
Launch:

  winRun.bat

For compilation on Windows basing on SALOME products already installed please use:

msvc9_env_Salome.bat

SALOME_ROOT_DIR is needed to be correctly set or located in "SALOME" folder of
parent to NewGEOM folder. For the current moment SALOME 7.3.0 compiled on
Visual Studio 2008 compiler is supported.
